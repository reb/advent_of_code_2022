/// --- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ---
///
/// The Elves begin to set up camp on the beach. To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the
/// snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.
///
/// Rock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each
/// round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand
/// shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper,
/// and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.
///
/// Appreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle
/// input) that they say will be sure to help you win. "The first column is what your opponent is
/// going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column--" Suddenly, the
/// Elf is called away to help with someone's tent.
///
/// The second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for
/// Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have
/// been carefully chosen.
///
/// The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the
/// sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you
/// selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the
/// round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).
///
/// Since you can't be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the
/// score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.
///
/// For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:
///
/// A Y
/// B X
/// C Z
///
/// This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:
///
///     In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y).
///     This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you
///     won).
///     In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X).
///     This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0).
///     The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 =
///     6.
///
/// In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8
/// + 1 + 6).
///
/// What would your total score be if everything goes exactly according to your strategy guide?
